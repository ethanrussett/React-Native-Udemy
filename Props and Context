Props:

-> Communicate information from a parent directly down to a child
-> Easy to Setup
-> To communicate data down multiple layers, we have to write a lot of code

Context:

-> Moves information from a parent to some nested child
-> complicated to setup, lots of speacial terms
-> Easy to commincate data from a parent to a super nested child

When Creating a context we get something called a provider

Provider is going to accept information and make that info availble to all child components
