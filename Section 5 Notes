State

Function called 'useState'
it is a hook, it adds new functionality to a already used function. In our case it will watch the couter variable

We never directly modify a state variable. React doesnt detect this change, Only use setter function

We can name our State variable anything

We can track any kind of data that changes over time. - int, sting, array, ect

When a component is rerendered get rerendered too

State Vaiables:

Generally we create state vairables in the most parent component that needs to read or change a state value

If a child needs to read a state value, the parent can pass it down as a prop

If a child needs to change a state value, the parent can pass down a callback function to change a state value as a prop
