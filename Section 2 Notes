Rules of JSX

We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML

We configure differnet JSX elements using 'props' ex. The style element in text  is a prop

We can refer to JS variables inside of a JSX block by using curly braces

We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then show that variable inside of a JSX block

Common Error
